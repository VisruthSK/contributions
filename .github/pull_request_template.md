To contribute your packages to the r-releases R universe, please create a text file for each new package and store all the text files in the `packages/` folder. Each text file has these requirements:

1. The name of the file is the package name.
2. The file contains a single line with the package URL. The URL must be authentic and genuine. It must be the true location of the package according to its true owners.
3. The file ends with a newline character. (A terminating newline is included automatically if you create the file using the GitHub web interface.)

Well-formed contributions to add packages are automatically merged every hour. If there is a problem with the automated checks, or if the goal of your pull request is to modify or remove one or more packages, then your pull request will be flagged for manual review.

If your first pull request encounters an error and you know how to fix it, you can avoid manual review by closing the current pull request and opening a new one.

Please visit https://github.com/r-releases/help for more information. Please send bug reports to https://github.com/r-releases/help/issues and other feedback and questions to https://github.com/r-releases/help/discussions.
